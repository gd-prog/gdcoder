Aggressive cows

Problem Description
Farmer John has built a new long barn with N stalls. Given an array of integers A of size N where each element of the array represents the location of the stall and an integer B which represents the number of cows.
His cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, John wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

Time Complexity:
	• Worst-case: O(N * log(N))
	• Best-case: O(N * log(N))
	• Average-case: O(N * log(N))
Explanation:
The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting of the A array using Arrays.sort(). This is typically implemented using a variation of the quicksort or mergesort algorithm, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(N * log(N)).
The binary search loop in the solve function iterates at most log(N) times, as it halves the search space in each iteration. The canPlaceCows function iterates through the array once (O(N)), but since it's called within the binary search loop, its overall contribution to the time complexity is O(N * log(N)).
Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, making it O(N * log(N)) in all cases.
Space Complexity:
	• Worst-case: O(N)
	• Best-case: O(N)
	• Average-case: O(N)
Explanation:
The space complexity is primarily determined by the A array and the temporary variables used within the functions. The A array itself occupies O(N) space, as its size is proportional to the number of elements. The temporary variables used in the solve and canPlaceCows functions are constant in size and do not significantly impact the overall space complexity.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(N), primarily due to the storage of the A array.
In summary:
	• The time complexity is O(N * log(N)) due to the sorting operation.
	• The space complexity is O(N) primarily due to the A array.
